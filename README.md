# Hash-Table-C
This is a small project following a tutorial on implementing the hash table data structure in C. 

Most of the code is admittedly from the tutorial, but the basis of doing this project was to learn more about the underlying implementation of a hash table (despite knowing it in Java), and to gain further exposure to the C language.
